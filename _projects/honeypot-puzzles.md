Positioned as a work of "historico-cruciverbal" research, _Toward A New Understanding of the Honeypot Puzzle Fragments_ is a print zine of crossword puzzles (with a Spelling Bee twist) created by Ross Trudeau and me. It was released on Kickstarter with over 500 copies sold to backers on 4 continents before launch.
