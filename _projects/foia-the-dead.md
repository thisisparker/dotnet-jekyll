FOIA The Dead is a transparency project that automates public records requests to the FBI for subjects of New York Times obituaries. Launched in 2017 and then operated for several years as a Special Project at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, it has released thousands of pages of documents on dozens of notable people, and received coverage in NPR's [Weekend Edition](https://www.npr.org/2017/04/01/522284735/finding-fbi-files-of-the-dead), [Note to Self](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/notetoself/episodes/foia-fbi-file), [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/foia-dead-565012), [NiemanLab](https://www.niemanlab.org/2017/03/foia-the-dead-uses-the-new-york-times-obituaries-to-shine-a-light-on-fbi-surveillance-for-the-living/) and more.
