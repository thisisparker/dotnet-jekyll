Cursewords is a full-featured Python terminal client for opening and solving crosswords puzzles, originally developed for my personal use on Linux. Its downs-only mode was featured in a [Wall Street Journal article on that solving constraint](https://www.wsj.com/articles/todays-crossword-too-easy-the-most-intrepid-solve-down-clues-only-11556030620), and I was interviewed for [Beyond Wordplay](https://beyondwordplay.com/curses-a-conversation-with-parker-higgins-5e97ea764f52) about it. Ross and I use Cursewords to solve puzzles on our Twitch stream, [Cursewords Live](https://cursewords.live).
