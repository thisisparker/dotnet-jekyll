This command-line tool scrapes online crossword puzzle solving interfaces to produce standard .puz files suitable for archiving, analysis, or solving locally. Originally started to scratch a personal itch, the tool has expanded to cover 20+ outlets and a number of embedded solving stacks, includes code from more than a dozen contributors, and has become a key pipeline component for cool crossword projects such as [Spread the Word(list)](https://www.spreadthewordlist.com/), Saul Pwanson's [xd data](https://xd.saul.pw/data), and the [Daily Crossword Links](https://dailycrosswordlinks.com/) newsletter, and is supported as a plug-in in [Gnome Crosswords](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Crosswords).
