_1923_ was a year-long zine series consisting of archival material from the year 1923. It was launched on Kickstarter in January of 2019, where the 100 available subscriptions sold out in about two hours. The series was accessioned into [Harvard's Houghton Library](https://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/99155775083403941/catalog), and the 2022 site relaunch got a nice write-up from [Mathew Ingram](https://mathewingram.com/work/index.php/2022/01/29/a-monthly-zine-of-public-domain-treasures/).
