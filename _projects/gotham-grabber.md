In the wake of the abrupt 2017 shutdown of popular local news blogs Gothamist and DNAinfo, I wrote a [collection of scripts](https://github.com/freedomofpress/gotham-grabber) that use browser automation to make high-quality portfolio-ready PDFs of articles. I wrote about the [significance of the issue and the "billionaire problem" in journalism](https://freedom.press/news/saving-gothamist-archives-journalisms-billionaire-problem/) for the Freedom of the Press Foundation, and the tool and its use were written up in [Nieman Lab](https://www.niemanlab.org/2017/11/here-are-three-tools-that-help-digital-journalists-save-their-work-in-case-a-site-shuts-down/) and elsewhere. In 2019 I expanded the tool to [work with more sites such as Splinter and Deadspin](https://freedom.press/news/preserving-threatened-archives-splinter-and-deadspin/), and ultimately created more than 100,000 PDFs for affected journalists.
