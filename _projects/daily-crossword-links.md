Since 2021 I have provided technical support for Matthew Gritzmacher's Daily Crossword Links newsletter, which compiles links to published crosswords from hundreds of mainstream and independent outlets each day. I developed an automated pre-publication workflow that cut production time significantly, allowing a team of volunteer editors to send updates to thousands of subscribers each day.
