fill harmonics is an online music machine with crossword puzzle mechanics, built in collaboration with Natan Last for Max Neely-Cohen's [10,000 Drum Machines](https://10kdrummachines.com/) project. It is built in Javascript and uses Tone.js for in-browser synthesis and sample playback. It was featured on [the Waxy.org linkblog](https://waxy.org/2025/09/fill-harmonics/) and [the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/09/12/fill-harmonics-a-crossword-puzzle-drum-machine/).
