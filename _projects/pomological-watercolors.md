I found the USDA's [Pomological Watercolor Collection](https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/usda_pomological_watercolor) online in 2015 and was captivated. After filing a series of FOIA requests about the paintings, I led a [successful advocacy campaign](/2015/04/us-government-release-7584-fruit-pictures/) to have high-resolution scans put online. I then uploaded the collection to Wikimedia Commons, and developed my first Twitter bot, [@pomological](https://twitter.com/pomological) to post images from the collection. I spoke about this process [at the National Archives](/2015/10/vegetation-wants-to-be-free-a-wikicon-talk-on-pomological-watercolors/) during Wikicon 2015, and my work has been written up Mashable (["Twitter's pleasant 'old fruit pictures' bot has a fascinating origin story"](https://mashable.com/article/old-fruit-pictures-pomological-twitter-bot)), [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/usda-watercolors), and elsewhere.
