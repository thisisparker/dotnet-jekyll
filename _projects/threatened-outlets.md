In partnership with the Internet Archive, I led a Freedom of the Press Foundation project to create online backups of a collection of news sites that we deemed to be under threat of shutdown or tampering. At launch, [I spoke with the New York Times for an article about the effort](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/business/media/gawker-archives-press-freedom.html), and wrote about the project and its context for [Freedom or the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press/news/archiving-alternative-press-threatened-wealthy-buyers/). The project's launch was also covered by [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/gawker-archives-freedom-of-press-foundation-toast-la-weekly/), [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/01/freedom-of-the-press-foundation-will-preserve-gawkers-archives/), [the Observer](https://observer.com/2018/02/gawker-freedom-of-the-press-foundation/), and more.
