The [@78_sampler](https://twitter.com/78_sampler) Twitter bot pulls from the Internet Archive's massive collection of [digitized 78rpm records](https://archive.org/details/georgeblood). After [releasing the bot in 2017](/2017/08/new-bot-78_sampler-serving-up-old-records/), I gave it a [substantial overhaul in 2020](https://twitter.com/xor/status/1287171354131943424), using OpenCV to find the actual labels in the record images and animate a spinning disk. Animation components on the record spin were drawn by [the incomparable Noah Jodice](https://noahjodice.com/), and the source code for this project is [available on Github](https://github.com/thisisparker/78_sampler/).
