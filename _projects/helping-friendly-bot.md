The Helping Friendly Bot provides information about songs that the band Phish is currently playing, pulled from an [online Phish.net database](https://phish.net/). The tech stack has evolved over time; at present, it monitors an official account for song updates through Bluesky's [Jetstream](https://parkerhiggins.net/2025/04/realtime-bluesky-events-jetstream-for-helping-friendly-bot/), posts general information [as a Bluesky reply](https://bsky.app/profile/helpingfriendly.xor.blue) and [on Mastodon](https://shakedown.social/@helpingfriendlybot/), and sends personalized details through Signal.
