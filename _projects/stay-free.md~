Working with whistleblower Edward Snowden, I served as creative and technical lead on a project to create an artwork called "Stay Free," combining an iconic portrait with the entirety of a landmark court ruling on an NSA mass surveillance program. The artwork [sold at auction in 2021](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388548/edward-snowden-nft-freedom-of-the-press-stay-free) for over $5 million to benefit Freedom of the Press Foundation.
