I wanted a t-shirt in the style of the famous [Experimental Jetset Beatles shirt](http://www.experimentaljetset.nl/archive/john-paul-ringo-george), but with the [traditional Alice &amp; Bob placeholder names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob#Cast_of_characters) from crypto discussions. There were a few options for similar things—Bits of Freedom in the Netherlands has [one that has Alice and Bob but also intelligence officials](https://www.tjunk.com/nl/Producten/product/558/productvariant/374/Alice-Bob-Zwart), and there are [other designs online](http://www.zerodayclothing.com/products/aliceandbob/aliceandbob.php)—but none was quite what I wanted.

Fortunately, it was easy to whip together a pretty convincing looking chunky white Helvetica list of names. From there, I used a company called Teespring, which lets you pick the printing threshold and retail cost. At first I just made [the cut I wanted for myself](http://teespring.com/crypto-jetset-alice-bob)—white text on a black men’s American Apparel shirt—but a bunch of my friends asked [for women’s cuts](http://teespring.com/crypto-jetset-alice-bob-w), and it’s very clear to me in retrospect I should’ve made them in the first place.

Both campaigns “tipped” in the first day online, so men’s and women’s t-shirts will be printed in the next few weeks. So far, 40 shirts have been sold—it’s definitely kind of remarkable to think that sprung from my off-hand idea.

I’ve gotten other shirts from Teespring and the quality is high, so I’m looking forward to wearing it. If you want one of these, get it quick!
