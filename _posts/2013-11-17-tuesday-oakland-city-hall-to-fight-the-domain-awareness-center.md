This Tuesday, November 19, [Oakland City Council will hear comments](https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2013/11/14/18746384.php) on its plan to spend $7 million of DHS money on [a “Domain Awareness Center”](http://oaklandwiki.org/DAC) that would aggregate surveillance data from many different channels about the residents of Oakland. The New York Times wrote up [some of the privacy concerns](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/14/technology/privacy-fears-as-surveillance-grows-in-cities.html) people have with such a plan. I made the flyer above (please share widely!), will be attending, and have submitted a comment card.
