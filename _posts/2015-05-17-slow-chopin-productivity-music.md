When I’m writing, it’s nice to have music that won’t try to distract me. Unfortunately that rules out lyrics and sometimes even melodies. One trick I like is slowing down nice, existing music to the point where it is more of a texture than a song.

Here’s a [public domain recording of Chopin’s “Anhang,”](https://archive.org/details/musopen-chopin) funded by the [Musopen Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/Musopen/set-chopin-free/description) to release free recordings of his entire oeuvre, slowed down by a factor of eight with [Audacity’s paulstretch plugin](http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/paulstretch.html).

When I went to upload it, I wanted a cool cover graphic. I took one of the only known photos of Chopin, and glitched it manually with a hex editor, entering new values, copying and pasting, and deleting things sort of at random. This was my first time glitching an image like that, and I relied heavily on tutorials from [Doc Pop](http://www.docpop.org/2014/01/a-glitch-primer-editing-image-files-with-text-editors/) and [Steen](http://www.certainly-strange.com/?p=548) for how to do it. I couldn’t really get anything to work with a PNG, but once I converted to JPG I was able to get something like this.
