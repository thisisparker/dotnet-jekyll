My short audio project [Supreme Court Clouds (2014)](https://parkerhiggins.net/2014/04/supreme-court-clouds/) has gotten a little bit of media attention (largely on the back of my, y’know, [real observations about the Supreme Court and technology](https://parkerhiggins.net/2014/04/the-supreme-courts-real-technology-problem/).)

It was described in [a recent Reuters story](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/09/us-usa-court-tech-idUSKBN0DP0PR20140509), along with a quote from me about the level of tech-savvy in the Supreme Court. It is also linked in [the opening sentence of this Guardian column](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/03/technology-law-us-supreme-court-internet-nsa), which is great.
