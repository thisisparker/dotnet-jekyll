Tetris may be the perfect game, but the beauty of its play is woefully ephemeral. Worse, the lack of a consistent and robust system for recording and annotating individual tetromino drops has, for decades, stunted serious scholarship.

The problem is clear. Now, [Tim Hwang](http://brosephstalin.com/) and I have [proposed a solution](http://brosephstalin.com/2012/12/11/tetris-system-being-a-recording-method-for-matches-of-the-puzzle-game/). Presenting[^1] TETRIS-SYTEM, being a recording method for matches of the puzzle-game.

[TETRIS-SYSTEM, V1](http://www.scribd.com/doc/117585129/TETRIS-SYSTEM-V1 "View TETRIS-SYSTEM, V1 on Scribd")

The notation may feel unfamiliar at first, but even a novice Tetris player will quickly get the hang of it. We hope that one day Tetris scholars, like composers flipping through the sheet music of a symphony, will be able to reconstruct the movements and interplay in their mind’s eyes.

[^1]: Yes, Tim presented it two weeks ago. I agreed to a press embargo for that duration.
