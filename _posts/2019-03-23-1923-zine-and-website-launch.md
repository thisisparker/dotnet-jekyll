Towards the beginning of this year I ran a [Kickstarter campaign for a monthly zine](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/887675031/1923-a-monthly-zine-of-public-domain-treasures/description) of archival material from the year 1923.

That year has some copyright and public domain significance. For twenty years following [the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act), 1922 was the most recent publication year for which a given work could be categorically determined to be in the public domain. That made “1922 and earlier” [a common category for digitized databases](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151102/16255832697/copyright-terms-how-historical-journalism-is-disappearing.shtml) of older works. On January 1, that border advanced for the first time in two decades, and the zine is something of a celebration of that fact.

Anyway.

The zines sold out quickly—I only intended to offer a hundred subscriptions, which were snapped up in about two hours—and so I added a “digital subscription” option. That meant I would have to figure out how to distribute the zines digitally too, but I was probably going to want to do that anyhow.

I sent out and posted (for backers only) the first two issues together after the campaign closed in the beginning of February. This week I sent out and posted the third issue, and so I’ve removed the “paywall” for the first two.

Which means: you can now check out the January and Feburary issues of *1923* at [1923.press](https://1923.press/).

This has been a big endeavor for me, and I’ve had to learn a lot about a tiny area of publishing and fulfillment.

In the coming days I’m going to publish some notes about my zine-creating process, which I think is sort of idiosyncratic but may also be instructional. I’ve written a few scripts and one-liners to ease the process, and I’d love if those ended up being helpful to other zine makers!
