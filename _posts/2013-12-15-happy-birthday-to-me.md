Today’s my birthday. And although [I believe](http://unhappybirthday.com/) that the traditional “Happy Birthday” song is [in the public domain](http://variety.com/2013/biz/news/court-keeps-candles-lit-on-dispute-over-happy-birthday-copyright-1200703048/) but for [copyfraud](http://www.copyfraud.com/) of enormous proportion, it’d still be nice to partake in a new musical tradition. The Free Music Archive held a contest this year to write a new birthday tune. [They picked some pretty great winners](http://www.freemusicarchive.org/curator/FMA/blog/Announcing_the_Happy_Birthday_Replacement_Songs)!

If singing isn’t your jam, I recommend today only the [Open Goldberg](http://www.opengoldbergvariations.org/) free culture recording of Bach’s Goldberg Variation 26. The whole collection is great, but 26 for my birthday.
