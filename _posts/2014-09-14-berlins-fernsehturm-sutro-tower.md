I realized today that despite spending a lot of time looking at each of them, I didn’t know which was taller: [Berlin’s Fernsehturm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernsehturm_Berlin) or [Sutro Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutro_Tower). Quick answer is the TV Tower is quite a bit taller if you don’t take into account the elevation of Mount Sutro, but in order to visualize it better I stuck them next to each other, at scale.

Fortunately there’s a [public domain version of the TV tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kontur-BerlinerFernsehturm.svg) available on Wikipedia as an SVG. I simplified and vectorized the version that Sutro Tower, Inc. uses in [its antennae diagrams](https://sutrotower.org/#diagrams).
