I spent Friday and Saturday at [Shift CTRL](https://events.stanford.edu/events/590/59041/), a great academic conference in Stanford. There was a little more free time to explore the campus than on previous times I’ve been down there, because I had a bike and was by myself. Fortunately, I got tips to visit the [cactus garden](http://bgm.stanford.edu/groups/grounds/special/arizona) and the [Stone River sculpture](https://museum.stanford.edu/news_room/archived_acquisitions_goldsworthy.html), both of which I recommend very highly as quiet, beautiful, contemplative spaces. Some pictures below.
