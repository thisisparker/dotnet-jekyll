The number of kinds of works covered by copyright has increased a lot over the years. The first copyright act, in 1790, covered just books, maps, and charts. Subsequent laws have added things like music, photos, and film. For a real history you can check [the Copyright Office circular](http://copyright.gov/circs/circ1a.html), but here’s an emoji timeline.
