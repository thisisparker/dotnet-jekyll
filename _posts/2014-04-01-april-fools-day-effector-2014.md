For the third year in a row (see [2012](https://parkerhiggins.net/2012/04/april-fools-day-effector/), [2013](https://parkerhiggins.net/2013/04/april-fools-day-effector-2013/)) I’ve put together [the April Fools’ Day edition of EFF’s EFFector newsletter](https://www.eff.org/effector/27/06). I feel like the tide has really turned against online April Fools’ jokes, but to my mind this is something different. There’s no trying to trick people, no ha-ha-this-is-the-opposite-of-what-we-normally-do, no lame fake acquisition, just jokes. What’s wrong with jokes?
