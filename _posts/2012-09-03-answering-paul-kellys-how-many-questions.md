I like this song by Paul Kelly, called “Careless.” It’s embedded below:

He asks a few questions in the song, and I’ve got the answers.

> How many cabs in New York City?

There are [13,237 taxis](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/about.shtml) regulated by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission.

> How many angels on a pin?

I think the answer to this is pretty conclusively [between one and 30 vigintillion](http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=2576).

> How many notes in a saxophone?

This one’s a bit tougher. These days, the standard accepted range for saxophone is between a B♭ below the treble clef to an F♯ above it. That’s about two and a half octaves, or a total of 32 notes. ((The glib answer, of course, is that there are twelve notes, repeated in various octaves.)) It’s possible, if a bit convoluted, to play a low A and a high G, so we can add two for a total of 34 notes.

> How many tears in a bottle of gin?

Assuming an average bottle size of 750 mL, and an average tear size of 6.2 µl (as per the research of [S. Mishima, A. Gasset, S. D. Klyce, Jr., and J. L. Baum \[pdf\]](http://www.iovs.org/content/5/3/264.full.pdf)), a bottle of gin could fit [121,000 tears](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=750+ml+%2F+6.2+µl). I don’t know why you’d want to do that, though.
