Three years ago, in the wake of the SOPA blackouts, the RIAA chairman and CEO Cary Sherman penned a [strange sour grapes op-ed in the *New York Times*](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/08/opinion/what-wikipedia-wont-tell-you.html). He claimed that the overwhelmingly popular position against the proposal was based on lies, that “neutral” sites like Google and Wikipedia were violating their integrity by taking a stance at all, and most tellingly, that “misinformation may be a dirty trick, but it works.”

He would know!

In any case, there’s now a single-serving site dedicated to preserving that message. Take it from the RIAA: [misinformation.works](http://misinformation.works).
