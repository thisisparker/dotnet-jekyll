While I was on vacation in Hawaii, my friends and I took a trip to [Edward Snowden’s former house](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/06/10/snowden-hawaii-neighbors/2410377/) in the Waipahu area. Not much to see—it’s just a house in a residential neighborhood—but we were nearby and thought it’d be fun to make the trip. Here’s a picture of the five of us posed out in front (from left to right, that’s me, Sarah Jeong, Marcia Hofmann, Kashmir Hill, and Trevor Timm).

We hatched an idea to come back with sidewalk chalk, and on the day I left for the airport we stopped by and I took to the street. Here are the results.
