**UPDATE:** I’ve done a lot of work on these and put together [a much more polished version](https://parkerhiggins.net/2010/12/metro-maps-kindle-screensaver/), which is now available in a later post.

I’ve put together [a set of screensaver images](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/kindle-ss-maps.zip) for Kindle models with 800×600 displays. (That’s all of them except the DX, as far as I know.) The collection is all segments of transit maps from around the world. For this first version, I’ve limited it to a handful of systems I’ve ridden, so this one includes ten maps from the US and Europe.

This is an early version, and doesn’t yet include a “Slide and release the power button to unlock” notice or anything. I’ll probably add that and improve the contrast on some of the images, which came out a bit gray. I’m happy to take other feedback, or suggestions for maps to include in later versions.

In case you haven’t done so yet, you can find instructions [how to jailbreak a Kindle and add custom screensavers](http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle_Screen_Saver_Hack_for_all_2.x_and_3.x_Kindles) on the MobileRead wiki.
