I’ve launched [a new weekly newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/5ua) on copyright, trademark, and patent policy with my friend [Sarah Jeong](https://twitter.com/sarahjeong/). It’s called 5 Useful Articles, which is [a pun](http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl103.html).

We announced the newsletter Monday and sent out [the first issue](http://tinyletter.com/5ua/letters/oh-oh-oh-it-s-magic-5-useful-articles-vol-1-issue-1) on Thursday to some 150 people. We’ve had new subscribers since then without much more promotion, so maybe people are forwarding it around!
