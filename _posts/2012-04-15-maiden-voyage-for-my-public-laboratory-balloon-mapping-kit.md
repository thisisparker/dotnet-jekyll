Last weekend, [Trevor](https://twitter.com/WLLegal) and [Maira](http://pragmalogi.com/) and I took the balloon mapping kit I received as a reward for backing the [Public Laboratory Kickstarter project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1775485688/balloon-mapping-kits) out for a spin. The kit is simple and inexpensive by design. It contains a 5.5 foot balloon, a very long string and winder, rubber bands, and assorted clips, rings and carabiners. You provide a camera, a soda bottle camera rig, and helium.

Public Laboratory has made the kits for [“grassroots mapping”](http://grassrootsmapping.org/), but for this trip up I was just interested in getting some photographs from the air and seeing how that goes.

We chose to fly at [Alta Plaza Park](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=37.79104&lon=-122.43744&zoom=17&layers=M) in Pacific Heights, because it was close to where the helium tank rental was, and the tank was about 40 lbs. Set-up was easy: Public Laboratory provides really good directions in the kit, and up-to-date video supplements online. The soda-bottle camera rig was a bit more complex than I had thought going into it, but Maira was a champ about putting it together.

Of the 600 photos or so we took, we got a handful of interesting ones. That may seem like a low yield, but I think it’s not bad for a first round. Here are some of my favorites:

To get a sense for the whole collection, I put together a video that speeds up the photos, taken about a second apart, to 6fps.[^1] The audio is from the public domain recording of [the Hungarian Rag played by Pietro Deiro](http://publicdomainreview.org/2011/08/01/hungarian-rag-pietro-deiro-1913/), found on the Public Domain Review.

I underestimated the complexity of grappling with the camera and the balloon in the moments before flying. For one thing it was just a bit too windy to be flying a balloon, but for another, we ran into an annoying technical bug. The camera I use, a [Canon Powershot SD 870](http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/digital_cameras/powershot_sd_series/powershot_sd870_is), has the necessary “continuous” mode, but defaults to single-shot mode each time it gets powered on.

That meant futzing with the controls once the camera was already on and in the harness, and trying to avoid any buttons. I think the photos we got are washed out because I knocked one of the settings off of automatic, but I couldn’t hunt down which.

Fortunately, each of these problems are solvable. Picking a calmer day, a clearer ground, and a heavier payload should help with the first.[^2] For the second, I’ve installed a firmware extension on my camera called [CHDK](http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK), or the Canon Hacker’s Development Kit, which allows for finer-grained control of camera settings. Before the next flight, I’ll be looking into the best configuration.

[^1]: I used the program mencoder to make this video. The command I used is listed in the video description on YouTube, should it be helpful.
[^2]: On a windy day, I could also take a kite out instead of a balloon, something I’m definitely looking into.
