I spoke last weekend at Wikicon USA about the several months I’ve spent learning about—and making more publicly available—the [pomological watercolor collection I wrote about](https://parkerhiggins.net/2015/04/us-government-release-7584-fruit-pictures/) in these pages last April. The talk is now online, and is about 20 minutes (and a bit frenetic).
