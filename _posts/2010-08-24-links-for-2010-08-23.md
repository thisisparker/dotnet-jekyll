- [The Imbroglio Over the Ground-Zero Mosque — New York Magazine](http://nymag.com/news/features/67635/) A really thoughtful article addressing the proposed Muslim community center two and a half blocks from Ground Zero. There has been a lot of ink spilled about it, but this article is really good.
