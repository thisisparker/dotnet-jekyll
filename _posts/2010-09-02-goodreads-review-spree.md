I’ve just gone on something of a spree adding reviews of the last few books I’ve read to Goodreads.

[The Forever War](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/101324560)

[Piracy](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/109147551)

[The Ask](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/101374209)

[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/105042641)

[Gun, with Occasional Music](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/113612914)

I really enjoyed all of these books, and I like writing the reviews, but it’s easy for me to put it off until I’ve got more time until I end up forgetting how I felt. I’m glad all of these are down on paper now, and I’m pretty much up to date on what I’ve read.
