[![three-birds](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/three-birds-300x208.jpg)](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/three-birds.jpg)Earlier this week I was treated to a visit from some two dozen of San Francisco’s wild parrots, the cherry-headed conures that live on and around Telegraph Hill. It was pretty spectacular — I was sitting at the kitchen table by the window, and first one, then two, then maybe a half dozen landed right outside on my balcony, occasionally conferring with a larger group that had set down on the roof.

I took all these pictures from the table with my phone, not wanting to get up and startle them, but they stuck around for some 20 minutes.

I hadn’t seen [the documentary about them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Parrots_of_Telegraph_Hill), though I had long been meaning to. I made a point to watch it last night, and enjoyed it, and it is definitely weird.
