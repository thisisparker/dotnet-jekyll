Inspired by the cover of [Newsweek’s now notorious return to print](http://mag.newsweek.com/2014/03/14/bitcoin-satoshi-nakamoto.html), I made a couple of bitcoin masks for mysterious Satoshi cosplay. In case it’s not obvious, that’s the bitcoin B on its side—a great look.

We actually made more than one mask. I think I like the one above, opera-glasses style, but there’s a flexible version that’s extra sparkly with elastic, too.
