In November 2005, Register of Copyrights Marybeth Peters gave an impressively candid answer about copyright terms being too long, and that she thought such a situation was a “big mistake.” Unfortunately link rot has begun to set in, and it was somewhat difficult for me to track down a copy of the video.

(When [BoingBoing linked to the video](http://boingboing.net/2006/02/21/copyright-office-hea.html) in February of 2006, YouTube was in its first year of existence, and far from the ubiquity it’s since achieved. Instead, the post points to AVI, MP4, and MPG files \[formerly\] hosted on [iBiblio](http://www.ibiblio.org/).)

I was able to dig up a version crawled by the Internet Archive, and have [posted the video more prominently](http://archive.org/details/MarybethPetersFormerUsRegisterOfCopyrightsOnTermsBeingTooLong) on that site.
