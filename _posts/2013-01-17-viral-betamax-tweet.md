I never know when the things I’m interested in around copyright policy have general appeal, and I definitely thought this vague joke — on the occasion of the 29th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s decision in *Sony v. Universal* (the Betamax case) — was a bit obscure.

> 29 years ago today, the Supreme Court ruled Betamax legal. As the studios predicted, it crushed the budding American film industry forever.
