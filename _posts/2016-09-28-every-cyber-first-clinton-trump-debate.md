The first debate between Clinton and Trump featured the word “cyber” 11 times. With any luck, the next one will have even more. Here they all are:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Every mention of &quot;cyber&quot; in the presidential debate <a href="https://t.co/V2yxVfJpdE">pic.twitter.com/V2yxVfJpdE</a></p>&mdash; Parker Higgins (@xor) <a href="https://twitter.com/xor/status/781291264427827201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

I edited this together with [Openshot](http://www.openshot.org/), which was a surprisingly tolerable experience.
