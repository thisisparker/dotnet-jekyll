The rainbow lines of BART always appealed to me, and I got an idea this morning to isolate just the lines and turn the colors up to something brighter. I’ll probably use the concept again, but in light of the ongoing strike (and especially in light of [yesterday’s fatal accident](http://bart.gov/news/articles/2013/news20131019a.aspx)), I decided to dedicate the first outing to the workers.
