Yesterday I posted a [ship in a bottle](/2013/05/ship-in-a-bottle/) from the [1922 book “Pirates,”](http://archive.org/details/pirates00john) and today I’ve had a chance to clean up a few more images, including most of the actual named pirates described in the book. The book seems to be scanned on a setting for text, and so the pictures require just a little bit of correction and cleaning. I’m pretty happy with the way these images turned out. Of course, since the book was released in 1922, all of these are in the public domain. So if you need a pirate drawing, go ahead.
