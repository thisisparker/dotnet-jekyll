- <div class="delicious-link">[Alex Payne — The Very Last Thing I'll Write About Twitter](http://al3x.net/2010/09/15/last-thing-about-twitter.html)</div><div class="delicious-extended">Some very smart thoughts on #newtwitter and decentralization by Alex Payne, who should know. I think it's a bit silly to refer to general micro-blogging as "lower case 't' tweeting", but I understand it and actually think it might be the most intuitive conceptualization for most people. That kind of thought is representative of Payne's smart take on "Twitter as a medium."</div><div class="delicious-tags">(tags: [newtwitter](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/newtwitter) [twitter](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/twitter) [alexpayne](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/alexpayne) [opinion](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/opinion) [decentralization](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/decentralization) [microblogging](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/microblogging) [statusnet](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/statusnet))</div>

(Yes, -dBs.) I highly recommend the experience of spending a few minutes in an anechoic chamber, if only for how bizarre it feels.</div><div class="delicious-tags">(tags: [orfield](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/orfield) [minnesota](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/minnesota) [anechoic](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/anechoic) [quiet](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/quiet) [audio](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/audio) [recording](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/recording) [cool](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/cool))</div>
