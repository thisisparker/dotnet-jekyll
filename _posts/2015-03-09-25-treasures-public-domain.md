Throughout the month of February, I thought it would be fun to share something cool from the public domain each day. I didn’t quite hit all 28 days—here and there I’d go a little too long without getting to my computer—but I ended up with a collection of really cool things.

I [shared them on Twitter with the hashtag #pdtotd](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=from%3Axor%20%23pdtotd&src=typd), which I imagined stood for “public domain thing of the day,” but I never explained what I was doing. My friend Zara took a look at it and guessed it actually stood for “public domain treasure of the day,” which seems like a better fit. Here are some of the things I shared.

## 1. Images from the New York World-Telegram &amp; Sun

![B8y0hniCMAAwSz_](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/B8y0hniCMAAwSz_.jpg)

The NY W-T&amp;S dedicated a [collection of photos to the public domain](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:PD_New_York_World-Telegram_%26_Sun), including portraits of civil rights leaders like Malcolm X and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. This seemed like an appropriate way to kick off Black History Month.

## 2. Extinct Birds (1907)

![B85jEfzCUAABeKF](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/B85jEfzCUAABeKF.jpg)

Beautiful pictures of birds already extinct over a century ago, scanned by the Internet Archive and [hosted on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/internetarchivebookimages/tags/bookidextinctbirdsatte00roth).

## 3. Anti-Suffrage postcards

![509c1aa04d102](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/509c1aa04d102.jpg)

As I tweeted, the early 20th-century anti-Suffrage movement had “strong misandry game”. These [historical postcards](http://bust.com/i-want-to-vote-but-my-wife-wont-let-me-check-out-these-vintage-suffragist-and-anti-suffrage-postcards.html) are interesting artifacts and freely available.

## 4. Highlights from the New York Public Library’s maps collection

![newyorkmap-1000px](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/newyorkmap-1000px.jpg)

NYPL has put [some 20,000 maps online](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/divisions/lionel-pincus-and-princess-firyal-map-division), with no known restrictions. The Public Domain Review, which I consulted a few times throughout this project, [picked out some highlights](http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/highlights-from-the-20000-maps-made-freely-available-online-by-new-york-public-library/).

## 5. NASA’s Apollo sounds

[Original audio from NASA missions](https://soundcloud.com/nasa/sets/apollo-sounds), including the famous “Houston, we’ve had a problem” and of course “One small step for man.”

## 6. Fundamentals of Rural Surveillance (1993)

![B9NElLlCUAA8xPq](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/B9NElLlCUAA8xPq.png)

The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center made this [somewhat dated PSA on rural surveillance tactics](https://archive.org/details/gov.ntis.ava19234vnb1), which I found as part of the Fedflix collection.

## 7. Kunstformen der Natur (1904)

![B9SXDOmCMAAzY1B](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/B9SXDOmCMAAzY1B.jpg)

Beautiful illustrations from [Ernst Haeckel’s book on natural forms](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Kunstformen_der_Natur). All available in high resolution from the Wikimedia Commons.

## 8. Unsplash photos

![photo-1415302199888-384f752645d0](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/photo-1415302199888-384f752645d0.jpeg)

Every 10 days, [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) releases 10 new high quality, high-res photos into the public domain. They’ve been doing it for almost two years now, and have quite a collection.

## 9. Landsat8 satellite photos

![LC80990822015066LGN00](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LC80990822015066LGN00.jpg)

The Landsat photos of Earth show remarkable natural landscapes from above. Charlie Loyd has built [an interface to view the latest photos](http://sat8.land/).

## 10. The Video Cellar

The Video Cellar collects movies that have fallen into the public domain or that were never subject to copyright restrictions, as a [popular YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheVideoCellar/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid).

## 11. 3D stereograms of Neanderthal skulls

![16305712920_120ab0990f_b](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/16305712920_120ab0990f_b.jpg)

One of the finds from the Public Domain Review’s excellent essay collection, the [story behind the GIFs](http://publicdomainreview.org/2015/02/11/neanderthals-in-3d-lhomme-de-la-chapelle/) is even more impressive than the images themselves.

## 12. Fantasmagori (1908)

![9815747855_fc3ce5080e_o](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/9815747855_fc3ce5080e_o.gif)

This is probably the [first ever animated film](https://archive.org/details/Fantasmagori), and it’s delightfully silly and strange. It wouldn’t take much to make this feel very modern and new.

## 13. Animal sounds from the Tierstimmenarchiv

The Berlin Natural History Museum has an [animal sounds archive posted online](http://species-id.net/openmedia/Category:Media_by_Tierstimmenarchiv_MfN), with 600 sounds from a wide variety of animals. Some are very mundane, but many are quite exotic. (h/t to Zara on this one.)

## 14. Emblems of Love in Four Languages (1683)

![B914dFICUAEV6Gq](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/B914dFICUAEV6Gq.jpg)

A [book full of pictures of Cupid](https://archive.org/details/emblemsofloveinf00ayre), etc, posted on Valentine’s Day.

## 15. Thomas Edison’s patent illustrations

![14569970970_70dc18ff81_z](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14569970970_70dc18ff81_z.jpg)

Thomas Edison’s patents were [bound together in a book](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/internetarchivebookimages/tags/bookidCollectionUnitev1Edis), which was scanned many years later by the Internet Archive. The illustrations are quite striking.

## 16. Early US currency

![US-$20-LT-1863-Fr-126b](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/US-20-LT-1863-Fr-126b.jpg)

The [$20 bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_twenty-dollar_bill) has looked about the same throughout my entire life, but it went through some really significant changes 150 years ago.

## 17. DOT pictograms

![dotpictograms](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/dotpictograms.png)

Developed in 1974, [these images are now a standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_pictograms) visual language. As with most standards, it works better when it’s free for everybody to use.

## 18. The USDA’s Pomological Watercolor Collection

![B-JuVUECUAAly4p](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/B-JuVUECUAAly4p.jpg)

[Over 7,500 watercolors](http://usdawatercolors.nal.usda.gov/pom/home.xhtml) from around the turn of the 20th century, depicting various species of fruits and nuts, and commissioned for the US government. This is an amazing collection.

## 19. Tokaido Gojusan-eki Hachiyama Edyu, 1848

![00405423eac254d0156ff335631c63fb](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/00405423eac254d0156ff335631c63fb-678x1024.jpg)

From the National Agricultural Library’s special collection comes this [1848 book of illustrations](http://www.nal.usda.gov/exhibits/speccoll/exhibits/show/rare-books/tokaido-gojusan-eki-hachiyama-) of full-size scenes and dwarf potted plants.

## 20. Screenshots of the Superfish vulnerability

![B-NlUhKIcAA88NS.png:large](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/B-NlUhKIcAA88NS.pnglarge.png)

In order to get legitimate information out about this security vulnerability as quickly as possible, @ErrataRob committed [his screenshots](https://twitter.com/ErrataRob/status/568409382070824962) to the public domain so journalists writing on deadline wouldn’t have to worry about getting in touch for permission.

## 21. Alex Wild’s insect shots

![flysex2](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/flysex2.jpg)

Alex Wild does all sorts of insect photography, and has a [small collection of impressive shots](http://www.alexanderwild.com/Professional/Public-Domain/) he’s committed to the public domain.

## 22. Free Music Archive’s Revitalize Music Contest entries

All of the entries to this contest are [new covers of public domain tunes](http://www.freemusicarchive.org/curator/WFMU/blog/The_Revitalize_Music_Contest). Entrants were required to release their new recordings into the public domain as well.

## 23. “Cabinet Cards” from the Houghton Library

![14799557053_44ba40d1f5_o](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14799557053_44ba40d1f5_o-1024x683.jpg)

Harvard’s Houghton Library has a wacky set of images from the theater collection’s 100,000+ cabinet cards. Some of the [highlights are up at the Public Domain Review](http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/cabinet-card-photographs-from-the-harvard-theatre-collection/).

## 24. The Fleischer Superman cartoons

The [1940s Superman cartoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_%281940s_cartoons%29#List_of_films) made at the Fleischer and Famous studios are classics in the genre.

## 25. Birds of America from the Audubon Society
