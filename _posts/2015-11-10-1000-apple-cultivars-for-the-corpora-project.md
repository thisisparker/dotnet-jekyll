The incredible botmaster Darius Kazemi has a [popular GitHub repository called “`corpora`“](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora), which contains, well, collections of all kinds of things. It can be really handy to have access to a list of words that all fall into a certain group, and so Kazemi makes it available completely freely and with a [CC0 waiver](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) to place it in the public domain.

Earlier this week I landed my first contribution to `corpora`: a collection of [1000 apple varieties, or cultivars](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/foods/apple_cultivars.json), picked from the metadata of the [USDA Pomological Watercolor collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomological_Watercolor_Collection). They are roughly the 1000 that appear most frequently out of 1500 or so, though a good chunk (200 or so of this corpus, and 700 or so of the overall collection) appear only once.

The names on the list are charming and goofy, and I hope they are useful to somebody. Here are some of my favorite cultivars:

- Newtown Spitzenburg
- Shiawassee
- White Winter Pearmain
- Royal Limbertwig
- Sops of Wine
- Peasgood Nonesuch
- Limber Limb Pippin
- Hollandberry Admirable
- Petite Douce Rousse
- Russian Gravenstein
- Sweet Nonesuch

It feels like a good way of extending the pomological watercolor work I’ve been doing into a community of artists and botmakers I’d like to support.
