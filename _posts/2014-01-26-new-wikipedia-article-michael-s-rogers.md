For the first time in a long time I have started a new article on the Wikipedia. This one’s about [Michael S. Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_S._Rogers), Navy Vice Admiral and presumptive nominee for Director of the NSA and head of the U.S. Cyber Command. These two jobs are the one being vacated by General Keith Alexander after he retires in mid-March, and obviously it’ll be kind of a crazy time to be taking over the NSA.

I thought a long time ago that it would be harder and harder to create new Wikipedia articles as most everything is covered by the million-plus pages on the site. But of course, the list of notable things will never stop growing right alongside.

It seemed especially important that Michael S. Rogers have a page now, because he’s likely to be in the news a lot more if he actually does get the nomination, and it’s perilously easy to confuse him with [Michigan Representative Mike Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rogers_(Michigan_politician)), Chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.[^1] These two men have a lot of overlap in their jobs, it’ll be interesting to see how the national security community decides to disambiguate them.

It’s also nice that there’s a public domain photograph of the guy from his Navy bio. That made the page come together and look like a real encyclopedia article quickly. I’d forgotten the feeling I get when I first make an article—I keep hoping somebody else will come along and edit and add and flesh the thing out. I guess that will happen pretty quickly if he gets nominated and confirmed.

[^1]: And there’s actually [a second Representative Mike Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_D._Rogers) in the House from Alabama.
