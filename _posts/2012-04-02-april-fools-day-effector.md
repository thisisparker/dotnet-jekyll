I wrote much of [the April Fool’s Day edition](https://www.eff.org/effector/25/10) of [EFF’s EFFector newsletter](https://www.eff.org/effector/), which we sent out to our subscribers yesterday. (Some of the stories there were submitted by my colleagues, and the brilliant lead story in particular is nearly entirely [Maira](http://pragmalogi.com/)‘s creation.) As far as I can recall, it’s the first intentionally funny writing I’ve done since Buckley’s [Student Voice](http://voice.buckley.org/) backpage in 2005-2006.

The reactions online were pretty good, and I’m proud of some of the jokes. I’m also not proud of some of them, but there they all are, one way or another.
