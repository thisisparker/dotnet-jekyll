The Supreme Court released a decision earlier this month that I think history will reflect on as a mistake. In <cite>Maryland v. King</cite>, the Court held that suspects arrested for “major crimes” could have their DNA collected and stored.

I rarely find myself in agreement with Scalia, but I think this quote from him sums up my frustration with the majority opinion.
