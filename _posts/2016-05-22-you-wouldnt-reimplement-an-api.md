I’ve been attending (and livetweeting) the [Oracle v. Google jury trial](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/05/stakes-are-high-oracle-v-google-public-has-already-lost-big) for the last two weeks, and have had a lot of conversations and made a lot of jokes about it. One joke that went surprisingly well was an image I made and tweeted without context:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/EuUZSH9PKh">pic.twitter.com/EuUZSH9PKh</a></p>&mdash; Parker Higgins (@xor) <a href="https://twitter.com/xor/status/731241298993152000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>  
In fact, the picture got enough retweets and replies that I decided to make [stickers](https://twitter.com/xor/status/733102946188066818). And [t-shirts](https://teespring.com/you-wouldnt-reimplement-an-api). And each of those things have gotten more attention than I expected. It’s been really exciting! I don’t have a distribution plan for the stickers besides handing them out in person (and self-addressed stamped envelopes to me at EFF), but there will be more than 300 t-shirts out there in the world. That blows my [Alice &amp; Bob design](https://parkerhiggins.net/2015/01/making-alice-bob-tees/) out of the water.

All this for being a pretty esoteric design. For one thing, the API reimplementation issue being litigated in Oracle is pretty arcane. For another, it relies on [an anti-piracy reference that’s a decade-plus old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmZm8vNHBSU) at this point.

The shirts will be donezo Monday evening—if anybody wants to print their own, here are the high-res source files you can send to a printer or put on a screen yourself. (The first one is white on transparent, so you have to change the background to see it.) I’d love to see your take on it!
