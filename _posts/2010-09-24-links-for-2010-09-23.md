(Also: maybe I'm dense, but this didn't seem like satire. Isn't it weird to call your piece "A modest proposal" and then not be over-the-top satirical?)</div><div class="delicious-tags">(tags: [corydoctorow](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/corydoctorow) [guardian](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/guardian) [security](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/security) [banking](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/banking) [passwords](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/passwords) [statistics](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/statistics))</div>
