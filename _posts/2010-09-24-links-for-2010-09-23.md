- [BBC News – Stuxnet worm 'targeted high-value Iranian assets'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11388018) Stuxnet is the craziest malware since Conficker, and if you believe the hype, it's way crazier. Four hitherto unseen Windows zero-days and it targets PLCs! Some researchers are suggesting it was built by a nation-state level entity to target Iran's nuclear power plants, but Schneier in unconvinced.
- [Promoting statistical literacy: a modest proposal | Technology | guardian.co.uk](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/sep/21/password-security-cory-doctorow) A discussion from Cory Doctorow about how a lack of statistical literacy and password fundamentals leads to inconvenient and insecure practices.

- [Looxcie Wearable Camcorder: Capture Unexpected Moments](http://www.looxcie.com/) A somewhat conspicuous but still rather small wearable camcorder/bluetooth headset that can buffer up to five hours of running footage and store four. Next step towards Snowcrash "Gargoyles."

- [Summer Guide 2010 – How Music Producer Dr. Luke Is Assembling No. 1 Hits — New York Magazine](http://nymag.com/guides/summer/2010/66784/) A profile of Dr. Luke, one of the masterminds behind a surprising number of smash hits in the past few years: "Tik Tok," "California Gurls," "I Kissed A Girl," "Right Round," etc etc. The description of his "curatorial" role is particularly interesting.
