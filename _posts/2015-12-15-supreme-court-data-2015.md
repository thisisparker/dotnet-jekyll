Here’s a supercut of all the mentions of the word “data” in last week’s Supreme Court Oral Arguments in [Evenwel v. Abbott](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/evenwel-v-abbott/), a case addressing the question of whether the “one-person, one-vote” principle of the Equal Protection Clause allows states to use total population data instead of voter population data in apportioning legislative districts.

Turns out, “data” came up a lot!

This follows a supercut last year of mentions of the word “cloud” in the ABC v. Aereo argument, [“Supreme Court Clouds (2014)”](https://parkerhiggins.net/2014/04/supreme-court-clouds/). The process of making this video was largely similar, though I’ve traded in `mencoder` for `ffmpeg` for cutting up, modifying, and muxing the video.

This time I thought it’d be nice to include some background music, so I turned to the [public domain recordings of various Chopin compositions](https://archive.org/details/musopen-chopin), created by Musopen. For the video, I used a segment of a [1958 educational film about computers](https://archive.org/details/6235_Information_Machine_The_01_29_03_15) made by IBM and sourced from the Prelinger Archive.

Both media sources, as well as the Supreme Court audio, are public domain. (All for different reasons, too: the music because of an intentional waiver of rights; the video because it was not noticed-and-registered and was made in an era that required formalities; and the courtroom audio because of [§ 105 barring federal employees from copyright](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/105) on their official work.)
