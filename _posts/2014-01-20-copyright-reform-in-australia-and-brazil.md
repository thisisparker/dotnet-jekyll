One of the excellent things about running [Copyright Week](https://www.eff.org/copyrightweek)—and there were many—is that copyright activists around the world gave some top-level overviews about what is going on in their countries. Two of my favorite came from regions where copyright reform has been long promised but yet to materialize: Australia and Brazil.

Here’s [what’s going on in Australia](http://blog.iinet.net.au/copyright-copywrong/):

> The [Australian Law Reform Commission](http://www.alrc.gov.au/news-media/2011-2013/copyright-enews-issue-9-final-report-delivered-g) (ALRC) has now delivered its final report on Copyright to the government. Current copyright exceptions have not kept pace with the digital world, and don’t adequately protect important internet-related activities such as [caching](http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/issues-paper/caching-indexing-and-other-internet-functions) or [cloud computing](http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/issues-paper/cloud-computing). From a consumer perspective, sharing photos (when you don’t own the copyright) on sites such as Facebook and Tumblr is [off-limits](http://faircopyright.com.au/social-media-sharing) – unless you have permission from the rights-holder. Or, in a professional context, you can watch a video on YouTube, but you [can’t include it](http://faircopyright.com.au/no-youtube-conference) in a presentation to colleagues at work, or for a conference. (Check out other examples of how Australia’s current copyright law is out of touch at the Australian Digital Alliance’s [\#copywrong](http://faircopyright.com.au/) site.)
> 
> The Attorney-General [announced](http://digital.org.au/content/alrc-recommends-fair-use) in December that the ALRC recommended “the introduction of a flexible fair-use exception as a defence to copyright infringement”, similar to that in place in the US.

And [here’s what’s going on in Brazil](http://creativecommons.org.br/blog/copyright-week-en/):

> …what is most troubling about the future ahead is that the entire copyright reform process could lose considerable momentum in 2014. A lot was already lost during 2013, considering civil society has turned its focus to Marco Civil. On top of that, the Snowden leaks and the upcoming [Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance](http://brmeeting.br/), to be held in São Paulo, have turned copyright into a secondary concern. Privacy and surveillance seem to have taken the front stage.

It’s great to follow copyright around the world, especially as deals like [the Trans-Pacific Partnership](https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp) threaten to export laws from all different countries. So it’s nice to have people in these countries laying out what’s happening on the ground there.
