Although the main point of [my airship trip over the Utah Data Center](https://parkerhiggins.net/2014/06/illegal-spying-below-my-trip-over-utah/) was to announce the launch of [Stand Against Spying](https://standagainstspying.org), I did have a pretty great view of the facility. Inspired by [Trevor Paglen’s efforts](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/02/10/new-photos-of-nsa-and-others/) to supply a new “visual vocabulary” to the conversation about national intelligence, I got [EFF to release one of the photos](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/releasing-public-domain-image-nsas-utah-data-center) I took under a [completely free CC0 waiver](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
