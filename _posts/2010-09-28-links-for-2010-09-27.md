- <div class="delicious-link">[Hey Twitter: Give us our Tweets](http://zachholman.com/2010/09/hey-twitter-give-us-our-tweets/)</div><div class="delicious-extended">A call for tweet data older than what is available on the site. It's nice to make the call, and it's great if Twitter listens, but unless you own your own data or have some control over the services you use, you're beholden to a corporation to make decisions in your best interest and often against theirs. The Twitter history issue is a good reminder of why open APIs and the like are not sufficient for free network services.</div><div class="delicious-tags">(tags: [twitter](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/twitter) [socialmedia](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/socialmedia) [identica](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/identica) [statusnet](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/statusnet))</div>
- <div class="delicious-link">[OUPblog » Blog Archive » The Sinister Influence of the Left Hand](http://blog.oup.com/2010/09/left-hand/)</div><div class="delicious-extended">An interesting look at the etymology of "left" and "right" in a bunch of languages. One thing I'm left curious about, though: given the common relationship between "left" and "north," where does English's "southpaw" come from?</div><div class="delicious-tags">(tags: [language](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/language) [etymology](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/etymology) [left](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/left) [right](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/right) [directions](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/directions) [word](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/word))</div>
- <div class="delicious-link">[U.S. Tries to Make It Easier to Wiretap the Internet – NYTimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/us/27wiretap.html)</div><div class="delicious-extended">Clipper 2.0: The US government is preparing to seek new regulation that will undermine encryption technology so that it can be wiretapped. I don't love drug dealers or terrorists, but it's hard to imagine clear-thinking people who see this as a good idea.</div><div class="delicious-tags">(tags: [encryption](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/encryption) [internet](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/internet) [clipper](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/clipper) [cryptography](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/cryptography) [nytimes](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/nytimes) [article](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/article) [interesting](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/interesting) [government](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/government) [politics](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/politics))</div>

A criticism of the people who advocate giving non-rivalrous goods away in order to generate demand for rivalrous goods, calling them hypocritical for doing exactly what they suggest. (I think that makes them hypercrites!)</div><div class="delicious-tags">(tags: [article](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/article) [stupid](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/stupid) [freemium](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/freemium) [corydoctorow](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/corydoctorow) [free](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/free))</div>
- <div class="delicious-link">[The Most Powerful People in New York – How Diaspora Is a Very Different Kind of Social Network — New York Magazine](http://nymag.com/news/features/establishments/68512/)</div><div class="delicious-extended">Congratulations to the Diaspora guys on a great New York magazine profile. This piece seems to miss the point less, although it's hard to find a source that isn't posing D* as a Facebook killer.</div><div class="delicious-tags">(tags: [facebook](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/facebook) [socialmedia](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/socialmedia) [newyork](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/newyork) [diaspora](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/diaspora) [article](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/article))</div>
- <div class="delicious-link">[Twitter, Facebook, and social activism : The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=all)</div><div class="delicious-extended">Well, some of this skepticism of social networks is well-placed, and I do think social media fanboys get a little breathless when describing the power of Twitter et al. But of course, Gladwell gets a little muddy when talking about the strengths and weaknesses of these loose-tie networks, and this piece certainly doesn't spell the downfall of the Twitterati, but it's worthwhile reading.</div><div class="delicious-tags">(tags: [malcolmgladwell](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/malcolmgladwell) [newyorker](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/newyorker) [socialmedia](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/socialmedia) [internet](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/internet) [twitter](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/twitter) [facebook](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/facebook) [civildisobedience](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/civildisobedience))</div>
