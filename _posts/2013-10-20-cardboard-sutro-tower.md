I’ve been building IKEA furniture, which means I’ve got a lot of giant empty cardboard boxes sitting around my apartment. It seemed a waste to just throw it out, so I decided to make something out of it.

Here’s my attempt at a model of Sutro Tower made entirely out of cut corrugated cardboard. I’ve got a [Dogme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogme_95)-like aversion to the use of adhesives or measuring devices, fueled in part by the fact that I don’t have any. Still, it sticks together pretty well, and is very sturdy, if a bit perpetually askew.
