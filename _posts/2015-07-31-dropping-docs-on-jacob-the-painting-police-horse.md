Muckrock has written an [article on Jacob, the painting police horse of St. Petersburg, Florida](https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2015/jul/30/horse-artist-jacob/), based on [documents I obtained through a public records request to the local police](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/pinellas-county-10455/horse-artist-jacob-17312/) in April. There’s no scandal here, but it’s fun to read about a city so smitten with their talented equestrian officers.

Perhaps my favorite missive comes from Kevin King in the Mayor’s Office, who writes:

> Wayne,
> 
> The painting police horse is rivaling Dali in terms of popularity in St. Pete right now.
> 
> Can your office work with Yolanda Fernandez in Police on harnessing this situation?
> 
> FYI – the most recent request came from Larry Biddle w Arts Xchange who would like the horse for a fundraiser (I believe)….

But they’re pretty much all like that. Many more clips [over at Muckrock](https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2015/jul/30/horse-artist-jacob/).

One small note: alongside the Jacob request, I filed one on info about the trademark applications on *another* celebrity police horse in St. Petersburg—Amos the Wonder Horse—and [came up empty handed](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/pinellas-county-10455/amos-the-wonder-horse-17313/). That’s a bit strange, considering the trademark [was filed in January](http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=86507083&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch)—it was just published for review a month ago—but you’ve gotta pick your battles.
