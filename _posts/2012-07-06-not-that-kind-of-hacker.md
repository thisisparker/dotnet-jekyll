Two articles that crossed my desk today described the difference between the two kinds of hackers. Howard Rheingold offered this distinction in [his memoir of the WELL](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/12/07/what-the-wells-rise-and-fall-tell-us-about-online-community/259504/):

> (when “hacking” meant creative programming rather than online breaking and entering)

The <cite>New York Times</cite> chose to explain it in [a story about “hacker hostels”](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/06/technology/at-hacker-hostels-living-on-the-cheap-and-dreaming-of-digital-glory.html?pagewanted=all) ((Incidentally, fellow Iron Blogger Rich Jones provides [another perspective on what hackers would really want in a “hacker hostel”](https://gun.io/blog/what-real-hacker-hostels-would-look-like/) on his own site.)) this way:

> the Mark Zuckerberg variety, not the identity thieves

Obviously both of these descriptions are simplistic, and maybe necessarily so, given the requirements of the overall pieces. But the <cite>New York Times</cite> distinction is just silly: the only “good” hacker is a capitalist hacker, I guess. Rheingold for his part may simply be acknowledging an evolving and warped perspective perpetuated by the media. As my colleague [Molly Sauter](http://oddletters.com/) explained in [a piece about the hacker as a modern folk devil](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/if-hackers-didnt-exist-governments-would-have-to-invent-them/259463/),

> The hackers who dominate news coverage and popular culture — malicious, adolescent techno-wizards, willing and able to do great harm to innocent civilians and society at large — don’t exist.

The playful curiosity that actually defines a “hacker” to me seems to be a hard thing to understand for many people, and the polysemy of the word doesn’t help.
