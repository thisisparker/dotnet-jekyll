Inspired by a [handful](http://thedickbar.com) [of sites](http://putadickbaronit.com) that have popped up in the last few weeks to mock a [design change](http://dickbar.org) made in the official Twitter app for iPhone, my buddies [Robb](http://robb.is) and [Johnny](http://johndadams.com) and I have put together a project called [the Dickens Bar](http://thedickensbar.com). The idea is simple — enter the URL of any website, and see it immediately enhanced by the “trending topics” of one of the most popular English novelists of the Victorian Era. See, for example, [this very site with Dickens Bar addition](http://thedickensbar.com/goto/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fparkerhiggins.net).
