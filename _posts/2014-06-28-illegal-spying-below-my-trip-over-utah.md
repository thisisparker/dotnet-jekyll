I flew in an airship over the NSA’s Utah data center yesterday, as part of a joint action organized by Greenpeace and EFF. It was really a remarkable experience, and we were lucky enough to get it covered by a pretty wide range of media. Here’s a small sample:

The airship itself looked pretty incredible. [EFF has more photos taken from the helicopter](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/diverse-groups-fly-airship-over-nsas-utah-data-center-protest-illegal-internet-spying), but here’s one, credit to Greenpeace:

I also got some photos from in the airship itself. The obligatory selfie with me and Sim, the pilot for Greenpeace:

And of course some of the data center itself (here in the background):
