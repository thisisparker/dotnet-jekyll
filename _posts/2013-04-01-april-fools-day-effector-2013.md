As with [last year](https://parkerhiggins.net/2012/04/april-fools-day-effector/), I played a central role in putting together this year’s [April Fools’ edition](https://www.eff.org/effector/26/09) of [the EFF newsletter](https://www.eff.org/effector). It’s hard writing things that are supposed to be funny.

I also feel, and I can’t tell if this is just confirmation bias, like maybe people are pretty much over April Fools’ Day jokes online. I had fun putting together this newsletter, but it seems like each year there are fewer jokes on other sites that I actually enjoy.

(ThinkGeek is usually an exception. Let’s see what they’ve got this year.)
