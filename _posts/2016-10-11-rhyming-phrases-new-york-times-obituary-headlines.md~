Many obituary headlines follow a standard formula: “Firstname Lastname, Who You Know From That One Thing, Dies at Age.” It’s a tendency I’ve counted on before when extracting names from obituaries for [FOIA The Dead](https://foiathedead.org/), but tonight it also got me thinking about the “who phrase”: the relative clause that condenses a lifetime of context into a handful of words.

I decided to pull out the “who phrases” from about 1000 headlines over the past year, and using `<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pronouncing">pronouncing</a>`, arrange them to rhyme (if not yet to meter). It’s poetry.
