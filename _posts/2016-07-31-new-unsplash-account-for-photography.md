I’m trying to take more pictures with my mirrorless camera, especially when I travel or walk around the city. I’ve always been a big fan of Unsplash, which curates high-res user-submitted photography and releases “packs” of images completely free to the public domain. So for now, I’ll be [releasing some of my favorite shots to the public domain](https://unsplash.com/@xor) and hosting them there.
