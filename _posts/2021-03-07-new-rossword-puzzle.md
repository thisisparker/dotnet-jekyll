[Sorry I Haven’t Posted](https://coryarcangel.com/news/2010/08/sorry-i-havnt-posted) for a while!

I do of course intend to return to the blog, yadda yadda, lots of updates to share. One quick thing that merits an update *today* is that I’ve co-constructed a crossword puzzle with Ross Trudeau over at [Rossword Puzzles](https://rosswordpuzzles.com/2021/03/07/babys-first-word). Go check it out.

Ross is a mentor to many in the crossword world, and I’m lucky to have weaseled my way into that cohort through being friends with him. We also (and this should be the subject of another blog post! The inspiration is returning, see!) host a regular Twitch stream called [Cursewords Live](https://www.twitch.tv/cursewordslive/), which involves a lot of solving puzzles in [my `cursewords` software](https://parkerhiggins.net/2019/03/cursewords-crossword-puzzle-solving-interface-terminal/).

Ross and I previously co-constructed a Universal Sunday puzzle ([available as a PDF](https://parkerhiggins.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/usun210110.pdf)) published on January 10 this year.
