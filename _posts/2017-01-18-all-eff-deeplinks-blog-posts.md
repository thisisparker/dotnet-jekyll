After five amazing years, I’m done (for now) at EFF. It’s impossible to boil the experience down into numbers, but here’s a big one: 215 Deeplinks blog posts bear my name as author. Here they are, collected in one place for posterity. After the [first hundred](https://parkerhiggins.net/2013/08/my-first-100-eff-deeplinks/) and the [second hundred](https://parkerhiggins.net/2015/09/200-deeplinks-at-eff/), I picked out some of my favorites.
