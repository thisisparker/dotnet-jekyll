Lou Reed died today at 71. His music — especially the the four Velvet Underground records — have always been very important to me. (If you must know, not actually *always*, but starting from the time Liza at Camp Half Moon loaned me *Loaded* and I listened to it over and over on my Discman.)

When a person dies, the privacy exemptions to the FOIA \[(b)(6) and (b)(7)(C)\] no longer apply. That means a federal agency like the FBI can produce records that might not have previously been available. Using Muckrock, [I’ve requested Lou Reed’s FBI file](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/lou-reed-fbi-file-8671/), which must be filled in 4 weeks but may actually come sooner. When [Rich Jones requested Ol’ Dirty Bastard’s FBI file](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/russell-tyrone-jones-ol-dirty-bastard-963/), that came in a week (and just days before Christmas, too).

**UPDATE:** on November 1 I got a response from the FBI saying there were no responsive documents. I find that hard to believe, but have no choice… unless I want to start rumors that they were withheld according to [5 USC §552(c)](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/552#c) because he was an informant or involved in ongoing crimes or something. Barring that—case closed.
