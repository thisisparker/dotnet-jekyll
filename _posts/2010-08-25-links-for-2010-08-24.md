The embedded video, "Du bist Terrorist" ("You are a terrorist", includes English subtitles) is a good example of the strong anti-surveillance and pro-privacy sentiment in Germany; it was one of those taken down.</div><div class="delicious-tags">(tags: [germany](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/germany) [privacy](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/privacy) [surveillance](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/surveillance) [video](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/video) [torrentfreak](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/torrentfreak) [gvu](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/gvu) [dmca](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/dmca) [copyright](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/copyright) [censorship](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/censorship))</div>

Brings common sense to the table, which is always welcome.</div><div class="delicious-tags">(tags: [copyright](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/copyright) [fashion](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/fashion) [chuckschumer](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/chuckschumer) [ip](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/ip) [newyork](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/newyork) [newsweek](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/newsweek) [ezraklein](http://delicious.com/parkerhiggins/ezraklein))</div>

Exactly the same feature Amazon got sued over.
