A decade ago today I published a blog post calling for the US government to [release its paintings of fruits](https://parkerhiggins.net/2015/04/us-government-release-7584-fruit-pictures/). The Pomological Watercolor Collection, as I had recently come to know, is a beautiful and remarkable corpus of over 7,000 pictures of fruits and other biological specimens, made between the 1880s and 1940s. Through a handful of FOIA requests I'd learned that the images had been meticulously digitized and put online for purchase, but that less than 100 pictures had been sold that way — not nearly enough to justify the paywall.

It was a strange rallying call, and certainly feels like it comes from a different era, but (if I may humbly say so) it worked. Within a few months, the National Agricultural Library put their high-resolution scans online, and they remain available to [search and download](https://search.nal.usda.gov/discovery/collectionDiscovery?vid=01NAL_INST:MAIN&collectionId=81279629860007426). It's easy for me to imagine a version of this story where I declared victory and moved on to the next thing.

But that's not what I did! Now that the images were available, I wanted to [add them to Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:USDA_Pomological_Watercolors). In order to do so, I needed to create [some software that would handle the uploads](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:PomologicalBot). This was my first ever project in Python, and in many ways, the start of my life as a programmer. The domino effect here is a little mind-boggling for me.

Emboldened by that foray into coding, I created a [Twitter bot to post through the collection](https://parkerhiggins.net/2015/11/new-bot-pomological/). Social media bots as a medium became pretty important to me. That account stopped posting when Twitter became X, approximately, but it continues to this day on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/pomological.xor.blue) and [Mastodon](https://tech.intersects.art/@pomological). I found other weird opportunities to highlight the collection. I gave a [short talk at the National Archives](https://parkerhiggins.net/2015/10/vegetation-wants-to-be-free-a-wikicon-talk-on-pomological-watercolors/) for Wikicon 2015, made a [visualization video for a concert of carnatic music](https://parkerhiggins.net/2016/02/generative-tiled-watercolors-south-indian-music/), and added [a thousand apple cultivars](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/foods/apple_cultivars.json) to my favorite collection of datasets. I made buttons.

Most exciting to me, though, has been seeing the public collection flourish as I'd hoped it would. There has been [a coffee table book](https://atelier-editions.com/products/an-illustrated-catalog-of-american-fruits-nuts), [an academic exploration](https://www.kitchenartsandletters.com/products/heirloom-fruits-of-america), [a postcard collection](https://www.abbeville.com/products/fruit-an-abbeville-notecard-set), and [high-quality prints from an art seller](https://20x200.com/products/vintage-watercolor-berry-trio). The collection continues to get press attention — not just from interviews I did with sites like [Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/old-fruit-pictures-pomological-twitter-bot) and [Morsel](http://www.morselnewyork.com/foodart/2017/10/3/over-100-years-ago), but in [Open Culture](https://www.openculture.com/2019/06/the-us-government-commissioned-7500-watercolor-paintings.html), [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/usda-watercolors), even a [shout-out from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/dining/make-stracciatella.html). Just this year it got a [delightful write-up by Kelsey McKinney at Defector](https://defector.com/i-demand-the-national-agricultural-library-publish-this-book-right-now), one of my favorites.

I found the pomological watercolors through my [advocacy for the public domain](https://parkerhiggins.net/2015/03/25-treasures-public-domain/) — a cause that can sometimes feel a little lonely and dispiriting. Embracing these artworks, though, has changed my life for the better in so many ways over the past decade. I don't really have a big takeaway, and nobody's asking for advice, but: I have been so grateful that I kept pulling that string and following my curiosity and interest. I sought out this collection on a lark, and I have now spent ten years surprised and delighted by what I found.
