I’ve submitted two proposals for panels at next year’s South by Southwest festival in Austin. I really hope one of them gets picked. The PanelPicker is currently open for voting (I’d appreciate your votes!) and then I’ll know later this year if I’m in.

[Ebooks: A Coming War for the Soul of the Library](http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/4022) will be with my friends Audrey Evans and Nancy Sims ([@CopyrightLibn](https://twitter.com/copyrightlibn)) and cover the issues libraries face as publishers push for an ebook licensing model to replace the current [108](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#108) and first sale regime. I made a video to explain the panel:

The second panel proposal is called [Drones Gone Wild](http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/6458), and will be with my colleague Trevor, as well as [Ryan Calo](http://twitter.com/rcalo) and Nabiha Syed, who’s currently a First Amendment Fellow for the New York Times and who has been instrumental in [the EFF/MuckRock drone request campaign](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/07/eff-and-muckrock-partner-see-how-your-local-police-are-using-drones). (Trevor and I previously [spoke together about drones at HOPE](https://parkerhiggins.net/2012/07/pwn-the-drones-presentation-at-hope/) and we co-operate [@drones](https://twitter.com/drones).) We’ll be talking about the rise of domestic drones and the privacy problems they introduce.
