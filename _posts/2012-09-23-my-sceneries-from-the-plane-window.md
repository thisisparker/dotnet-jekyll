I was really struck by [Maira’s “Sceneries From The Plane Window,”](http://mairasutton.net/2012/09/sceneries-from-the-plane-window/) so I decided to shoot my own on my trip back from Portland. Her camera is better than mine, and the conditions in her plane were a bit better suited for photography, but I like the way some of these turned out.

 <style type="text/css">
			#gallery-6 {
				margin: auto;

			#gallery-6 .gallery-item {
				float: left;
				margin-top: 10px;
				text-align: center;
				width: 33%;
			}
			#gallery-6 img {
				border: 2px solid #cfcfcf;
			}
			#gallery-6 .gallery-caption {
				margin-left: 0;
			}
			/* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php */
		</style>

 </div>The object in the front of the photograph is the propeller, and my arm (and bright green wrist-band) are a bit too visible in these. Most unfortunately, though, I had to put my camera away for the descent; it’s too bad, because we got an incredible aerial view of San Francisco.

We got that view flying into Oakland from the north, so if you are doing that, I can recommend a window seat on the right hand side.
