Hi, my name is Parker Higgins. I am an artist and activist working in Brooklyn. I am interested in the theory and practice of copyright, and how it interacts with creativity. More generally, I like to think and write about questions of speech and privacy and technology.

From 2017-2022, I worked at the [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press), first as Director of Special Projects  and subsequently as Director of Advocacy. From 2011–2017 I worked as an activist at the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org).

Since 2020, I have picked up the hobby of constructing crosswords, after first building software to open and solve puzzle files in the terminal. Since then, puzzles I've constructed have appeared in the *New York Times* and many other outlets.

I am a graduate of NYU Gallatin, where I concentrated in Creativity, Freedom of Speech, and Intellectual Property. For a while I lived in Berlin and worked for [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com). I like public transportation systems and their maps, photography, vegetarian food, and good science fiction.
