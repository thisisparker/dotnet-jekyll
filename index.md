Hi, my name is Parker Higgins. I'm an artist and activist living in Brooklyn. My work has addressed the interplay between technology, society, and the law, with a focus on copyright, speech, and privacy issues.

I'm currently on a programming retreat at [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com). Most recently before that, I worked as a Developer Advocate at [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/), helping computer people build more human-friendly networks. I previously worked at the [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press), first as Director of Special Projects and then as Director of Advocacy, and before that as an activist at the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org).

Since 2020, I have picked up the hobby of constructing crosswords. [Puzzles I've constructed](https://parkerhiggins.net/projects/crossword-publications) have appeared in the *New York Times*, the *New Yorker*, and many other outlets. I am also a programmer, and some of my programming projects can be found [on my Projects page](https://parkerhiggins.net/projects/) or my [Github profile](https://github.com/thisisparker/).

I am a graduate of NYU Gallatin, where I concentrated in Creativity, Freedom of Speech, and Intellectual Property. For a while I lived in Berlin and worked for [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com). I like public transportation systems and their maps, photography, vegetarian food, and good science fiction.
