Hi, my name is Parker Higgins. I am interested in the theory and practice of copyright, and how it interacts with creativity. More generally, I like to think and write about questions of speech and privacy and technology.

From 2011–2017 I worked as an activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. I also previously served on the board of the international student group [Students for Free Culture](http://freeculture.org). For a few years I was the Director of Special Projects at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I am now the Director of Advocacy.

I am a graduate of NYU Gallatin, where I concentrated in Creativity, Freedom of Speech, and Intellectual Property. For a while I lived in Berlin and worked for [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com). I like public transportation systems and their maps, photography, vegetarian food, and good science fiction.
